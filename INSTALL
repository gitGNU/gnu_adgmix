Installing ADGMix
-----------------

Well making and installing ADGMix is very simple,
provide that you have the handy pkg-config, anyway
if you have compiled other programs chances are you 
have it already on your system, you must follow the
standard make chain, to do so just type:

make

and for installing adgmix systemwide:
(you need to be root to do this)

make install

The Makefile needs a lot of work, so be patient
if it 'just not works as espected', if so please
dropme a line and i will do my best to solve your
problem (see the manpage or the README file 
for contact information).

Please note that this is a development release
and it could have bugs that could cause serious
damage to your system/life/computer, so becareful
and stay in tune for the stable release .-)
