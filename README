ADGMix (Another Damn Gtk Mixer)


Description
-----------

ADGMix is a graphical tool that lets you interface
with your soundcard's mixer, it was writen using
the OSS (Open Sound System) API and the gtk toolkit
library.

Requirements
------------

You must have sys/soundcard.h, the one that comes
in most GNU Linux boxes with the default OSS setup
should do the trick. You also must have an OSS supported
soundcard (alsa supported card with OSS emulation should
work too), a working XFree86 installation, the gtk toolkit
library (2.0) and a working c compiler.

Geting the source
-----------------

There is no official release (and to be honest
being this little more than an example there
would probably never be one), but the version
in GIT is working just fine:

git://git.sv.gnu.org/adgmix.git
ssh://git.sv.gnu.org/srv/git/adgmix.git
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/r/adgmix.git

Installing ADGMix
-----------------

See the included INSTALL file for instructions
