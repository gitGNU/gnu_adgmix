Description
-----------

ADGMix is a graphical tool that lets you interface 
with your soundcard's mixer, it was writen using 
the OSS (Open Sound System) API and the gtk toolkit 
library. 

Requirements
------------

You must have sys/soundcard.h, the one that comes 
in most GNU Linux boxes with the default OSS setup
should do the trick. You also must have an OSS supported
soundcard (alsa supported card with OSS emulation should
work too), a working XFree86 installation, the gtk toolkit
library (2.0) and a working c compiler.

Geting the source
-----------------

There is no official realese yet, but the version
on the CVS is working just fine.  The main CVS 
repository is on subversions.gnu.org (/cvsroot/adgmix)


Installing ADGMix
-----------------

See the included INSTALL file for instructions
